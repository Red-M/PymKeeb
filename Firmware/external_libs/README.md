You're going to need these libraries:
- adafruit_bus_device
- adafruit_hid
- adafruit_mcp230xx
- https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar
- https://github.com/WarriorOfWire/tasko

Make sure they're also in the lib directory of the CIRCUITPY drive after you copy everything from the Firmware directory.
